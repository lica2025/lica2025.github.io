    <details open><summary><h2><u>Getting to Melbourne from MATRIX</u></h2></summary>

    <p>An airport shuttle bus will depart the MATRIX Institute at 14:00pm sharp on Friday 15th August, stopping at Melbourne city after the airport. Please prepare your luggage early. Participants staying off-campus may wish to bring luggage early in the morning and store it in the Reception Foyer or MATRIX House during the morning talks. </p>
    
    <p>Participants travelling to the airport on their own will need to take a taxi or number 30 bus to Ballarat Station with a Myki (check Google maps). Then, one may travel to the airport via the <a href="https://airportshuttlebus.com.au/">Ballarat airport bus shuttle</a> (reservations required). Otherwise, participants must then take a regional train to Southern Cross Station (Myki required) in Melbourne CBD and then take a Skybus to the airport.</p></details>

    <details><summary><h2><u>Getting to MATRIX</u></h2></summary>
    
    <p>The easiest way to reach Melbourne is through Melbourne Tullamarine Airport. We will provide shuttles on the 3rd of August from Ballarat to Creswick, and on the 15th of August from Creswick to Melbourne Tullamarine Airport. Details will be released later.</p>
    
    <p><b>From Airport to Ballarat:</b> We recommend an airport <a href="https://www.skybus.com.au/">Skybus</a> (tickets can be purchased on the spot) to Southern Cross Station, followed by a train to Ballarat Train Station. Alternatively, one can reserve a <a href="https://airportshuttlebus.com.au/">Ballarat airport bus shuttle</a> going directly from Melbourne Tullamarine Airport to Ballarat Train Station. </p>
    
    <p><b>From Ballarat to MATRIX:</b> We recommend taking one of the shuttles booked by MATRIX. Otherwise, you may take a train from Ballarat Train Station, or bus 30, to Raglan St/Albert St (Creswick) Station, and then arrive at the MATRIX Institute within a 10-min walk.</p> 
    
    <p><b>The Myki ticketing system:</b> Other than reserved seats on coaches or particular regional trains, one needs a Myki to travel on public transport in Victoria, including the aforementioned train between Southern Cross and Ballarat Stations and the bus between Ballarat and the MATRIX Institute. The cost is $11 per weekday and $7.60 per weekend. Simply tap your Myki every time you enter or exit a bus, tram, or train station platform — do not tap your Myki at all when using a tram in the metropolitan free tram zone. One may acquire and charge credit onto a Myki at any large train station, including Southern Cross Station. Note that the physical card costs a non-refundable $6. Particularly tech-savvy Android users may prefer to download a digital Myki onto their Google Wallet — there is unfortunately no digital support for Apple users.</p></details>

    <p>Participants staying off-campus must either take the number 30 bus described above from Ballarat or the RACV Goldfields Resort, or will otherwise be within walking distance of the MATRIX Institute.</p>
    <p>MATRIX does not provide lunch and encourages participants to support the local economy.
