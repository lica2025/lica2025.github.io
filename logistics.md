    <h2>Getting here</h2>
    
    <p>The easiest way to reach Melbourne is through Melbourne Tullamarine Airport. We will provide shuttles on the 3rd of August from Ballarat to Creswick, and on the 15th of August from Creswick to Melbourne Tullamarine Airport. Details will be released later.</p>
    
    <p><b>From Airport to Ballarat:</b> We recommend an airport <a href="https://www.skybus.com.au/">Skybus</a> (tickets can be purchased on the spot) to Southern Cross Station, followed by a train to Ballarat Train Station. Alternatively, one can reserve a <a href="https://airportshuttlebus.com.au/">Ballarat airport bus shuttle</a> going directly from Melbourne Tullamarine Airport to Ballarat Train Station. </p>
    
    <p><b>From Ballarat to MATRIX:</b> We recommend taking one of the shuttles booked by MATRIX. Otherwise, you may take a train from Ballarat Train Station, or bus 30, to Raglan St/Albert St (Creswick) Station, and then arrive at the MATRIX Institute within a 10-min walk.</p> 
    
    <p><b>The Myki ticketing system:</b> Other than reserved seats on coaches or particular regional trains, one needs a Myki to travel on public transport in Victoria, including the aforementioned train between Southern Cross and Ballarat Stations and the bus between Ballarat and the MATRIX Institute. The cost is $11 per weekday and $7.60 per weekend. Simply tap your Myki every time you enter or exit a bus, tram, or train station platform — do not tap your Myki at all when using a tram in the metropolitan free tram zone. One may acquire and charge credit onto a Myki at any large train station, including Southern Cross Station. Note that the physical card costs a non-refundable $6. Particularly tech-savvy Android users may prefer to download a digital Myki onto their Google Wallet — there is unfortunately no digital support for Apple users.</p>

    <h2>Getting Around Campus</h2>

    <p>We are able to provide on-campus accommodation to select participants for part of their stay, with preference given to students, early career researchers, and those who would benefit from support.</p>
    <p>Participants staying on campus will be staying at either Semmens Hall or The Lodge, described <a href="https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/accommodation">here</a>; see campus map below.</p>
    <p>Participants staying off-campus must either take the bus 30 described above from Ballarat or the RACV Goldfields Resort, or will otherwise be within walking distance of the MATRIX Institute.</p>
    <p>MATRIX does not provide lunch and encourages participants to support the local economy. Please see <a href="https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/wp_Matrix2016/wp-content/uploads/Creswick/EATERIES-AND-FOOD-SUPPLIERS-IN-CRESWICK-2021.pdf">this helpful link</a> for a list of nearby cafes and restaurants. Participants can also visit these establishments for breakfast and dinner (please check that they are open at suitable times!)</p>

    <h2>Weekend Trips</h2>

    <p><b>Ballarat 9th August:</b></p>
    <ul><li>A bus will leave the MATRIX Institute at 08:30am to go to the Ballarat Wildlife Park, where we will interact with native animals from 09:30am-11:30am.</li>
    <li>We will then take the same bus to Sovereign Hill, where we can have lunch at 12:00pm and then explore the living museum of Sovereign Hill, showcasing how Ballarat looked during the gold rush.</li>
    <li>Sovereign Hill closes at 17:00pm, but you may leave at any time, perhaps wishing to have dinner in Ballarat. Participants will make their own way back to the MATRIX Institute, either by taxi or using the route 30 bus to Creswick (note that a Myki is required for the latter option).</li>
    <li>Participants will need to buy their own tickets for <a href="https://wildlifepark.com.au/tickets/">the Ballarat Wildlife Park ($36 with online discount)</a> and <a href="https://www.sovereignhill.com.au/tickets/">Sovereign Hill ($52.50)</a>.</li></ul>

    <p><b>Melbourne 9th and 10th August:</b></p>
    <ul><li>A bus will leave the MATRIX Institute at 08:30am on both Saturday and Sunday to drop us off at Ballarat Station. We will then take a regional train to Southern Cross Station, arriving at 11:00am, which needs a Myki.</li>
    <li>On Saturday, we will take a bus from Southern Cross Station, corner of Collins St and Spencer St, at 20:30pm to return to the MATRIX Institute.</li>
    <li>On Sunday, participants will make their way back to the MATRIX Institute by taking the regional train back to Ballarat Station and then taxi back to Creswick.</li>
    <li>There is no itinerary in Melbourne, but Melbourne is a multicultural city (so one can find almost any cuisine they are seeking) that boasts some of the best coffee in the world. Of interest could be the National Gallery of Victoria, the Queen Victoria Market, Federation Square, the Comic's Lounge, the Capital City Trail (a 30km bicycling route around Melbourne - bikes can be rented at <a href="https://bluetonguebikes.com.au/bike-hire-rentals-melbourne/">Blue Tongue Bikes</a>), Old Melbourne Gaol, the Melbourne Skydeck, Melbourne Museum, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the State Library of Victoria, the Shrine of Remembrance, fairy penguins at St. Kilda beach, and a variety of gardens.</li></ul>

    <p><b>Bendigo:</b> Mario Kieburg is organising a weekend trip with overnight stay on Saturday night in Bendigo. Of interest is the goldmine, Golden Dragon museum, Bendigo art gallery, the theatre (now showing The Music Man), and Bendigo Park.</p>
