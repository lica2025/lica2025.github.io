    <h2>Getting here</h2>
    
    <p>The easiest way to reach Melbourne is through Melbourne Tullamarine Airport. We will provide shuttles on the 3rd of August from Ballarat to Creswick, and on the 15th of August from Creswick to Melbourne Tullamarine Airport. Details will be released later.</p>
    
    <p><b>From Airport to Ballarat:</b> We recommend an airport <a href="https://www.skybus.com.au/">Skybus</a> (tickets can be purchased on the spot) to Southern Cross Station, followed by a train to Ballarat Train Station. Alternatively, one can reserve a <a href="https://airportshuttlebus.com.au/">Ballarat airport bus shuttle</a> going directly from Melbourne Tullamarine Airport to Ballarat Train Station. </p>
    
    <p><b>From Ballarat to MATRIX:</b> We recommend taking one of the shuttles booked by MATRIX. Otherwise, you may take a train from Ballarat Train Station, or bus 30, to Raglan St/Albert St (Creswick) Station, and then arrive at the MATRIX Institute within a 10-min walk.</p> 
    
    <p><b>The Myki ticketing system:</b> Other than reserved seats on coaches or particular regional trains, one needs a Myki to travel on public transport in Victoria, including the aforementioned train between Southern Cross and Ballarat Stations and the bus between Ballarat and the MATRIX Institute. The cost is $11 per weekday and $7.60 per weekend. Simply tap your Myki every time you enter or exit a bus, tram, or train station platform — do not tap your Myki at all when using a tram in the metropolitan free tram zone. One may acquire and charge credit onto a Myki at any large train station, including Southern Cross Station. Note that the physical card costs a non-refundable $6. Particularly tech-savvy Android users may prefer to download a digital Myki onto their Google Wallet — there is unfortunately no digital support for Apple users.</p>

    <h2>Getting Around Campus</h2>

    <p>We are able to provide on-campus accommodation to select participants for part of their stay, with preference given to students, early career researchers, and those who would benefit from support.</p>
    <p>Participants staying on campus will be staying at either Semmens Hall or The Lodge, described <a href="https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/accommodation">here</a>; see campus map below.</p>
    <p>Participants staying off-campus must either take the bus 30 described above from Ballarat or the RACV Goldfields Resort, or will otherwise be within walking distance of the MATRIX Institute.</p>
    <p>MATRIX does not provide lunch and encourages participants to support the local economy. Please see <a href="https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/wp_Matrix2016/wp-content/uploads/Creswick/EATERIES-AND-FOOD-SUPPLIERS-IN-CRESWICK-2021.pdf">this helpful link</a> for a list of nearby cafes and restaurants. Participants can also visit these establishments for breakfast and dinner (please check that they are open at suitable times!)</p>

    <p>The <b>conference banquet</b> will be held at 18:00 on Wednesday, August 6th at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+American+Creswick/@-37.4226802,143.8845129,14.9z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x6ad1383357eb0e67:0xe51b5d633a80a8ed!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d-37.424898!4d143.894476!16s%2Fg%2F1td2mmdw?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDcwOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">The American Creswick</a> (90 Albert St, Creswick VIC 3363, Australia).</p>

    <p>The <b>MATRIX cheese and wine afternoon</b> event will be held at 15:10 on Tuesday, August 5th at the recreational room.</p>

    <p>There will hopefully be a local <b>stargazing walk</b> held after dinner at 19:30 on Wednesday, August 13th.</p>

    <p><b>Weekend trips:</b> There are local walking trails in Creswick that participants may be interested in; see <a href="https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/visit/#post-29">here</a> for information. Otherwise, unofficial trips to <b>Melbourne</b> and <b>Ballarat</b> will be organised on the weekend, 9th and 10th August. Further information is coming soon.</p>
    <ul><li><b>Ballarat:</b> A relatively local town with Australian history. Participants may be interested in learning about the gold rush at Sovereign Hill or see native wildlife at the Ballarat Wildlife Park. The Eureka Centre Ballarat may also be a museum of interest.</li>
    <li><b>Melbourne:</b> About 1.5 hours from Ballarat, hence 2 hours from Creswick (with carefully planned transportation), Melbourne is the largest metropolitan city in Australia. It is a multicultural city (so one can find almost any cuisine they are seeking) and boasts some of the best coffee in the world. Of interest could be the National Gallery of Victoria, the Queen Victoria Market, Federation Square, the Comic's Lounge, the Capital City Trail (a 30km bicycling route around Melbourne - bikes can be rented at <a href="https://bluetonguebikes.com.au/bike-hire-rentals-melbourne/">Blue Tongue Bikes</a>), Old Melbourne Gaol, the Melbourne Skydeck, Melbourne Museum, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the State Library of Victoria, the Shrine of Remembrance, and a variety of gardens.</li>
<li><b>Bendigo:</b> A weekend trip with overnight stay on Saturday night. Of interest is the goldmine, Golden Dragon museum, Bendigo art gallery, the theatre (now showing The Music Man), and Bendigo Park.</li></ul>
